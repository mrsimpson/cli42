/**
 * The history of a workspace as the web view reads it — the "pearl chain" of
 * commits that touched its documents. The web view owns this format because
 * it is its only reader; a CLI writes it (`build --with-history`, into
 * `history/`) and serves it (`serve`, under `/api/history/`) in the same
 * two-level layout:
 *
 * - `index.jsonl`: one HistoryPearl per line, newest first — cheap git metadata
 *   so the whole chain can be drawn at once;
 * - `chunk-<n>.jsonl`: one HistoryEntry per line for the pearls whose `chunk`
 *   is n — the diff and everything else that needs computing;
 * - `tree/<commit>.json`: the SnapshotTree of a commit — its documents (and,
 *   where a language needs them, every tracked path) — to open that version
 *   as a whole;
 * - `blob/<id>`: one document, stored once under its git blob id and shared by
 *   every commit that contains it.
 *
 * Plain TypeScript: no framework and no browser APIs, so a CLI can import it.
